# 📧 Spam Message Classifier

A web-based application to classify text messages as either **Spam** or **Ham** using a **Naive Bayes Classifier**.
The model is trained on a dataset of email messages, leveraging the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for text vectorization.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Message Classification**: Input any text message and receive an instant classification (Spam or Ham).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the classifier.
- **Naive Bayes Algorithm**: Efficient and fast text classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devarshi002/email_sms_spam_detector.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries:

```bash
cd email_sms_spam_detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Dataset Preparation

Ensure you have a dataset in CSV format named `emails.csv` in the project directory. The dataset should have the following structure:

```csv
text,spam
"Hey, are we still on for dinner?",0
"Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card.",1
```
- **text**: The message content.
- **spam**: 1 indicates spam, 0 indicates ham.

### 4. Run the Application

After setting up, you can start the app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run email.py
```

This will open your web browser with the Streamlit app interface.

## 🔍 Usage

- **Step 1**: Enter any text message in the input field provided.
- **Step 2**: Click the "Predict" button to classify the message as either Spam or Ham.
- **Step 3**: View the result (Spam or Ham) immediately below the input box.

## 💻 Code Overview

### `email.py`

This is the main file for the Streamlit app. It includes:

- **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset from `emails.csv`.
- **Vectorization**: Converts message text into a matrix of token counts using `CountVectorizer`.
- **Model Training**: Uses **Multinomial Naive Bayes** to classify messages.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a text input and a prediction button.

## 🔧 Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries, specified in `requirements.txt`:

- **streamlit**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**

To install these dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📈 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Vectorization**: Bag-of-Words model using `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn.
- **Dataset Split**: 80% for training and 20% for testing.
  
The model uses token frequency to predict whether a message is spam (1) or ham (0).

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- **Improved Preprocessing**: Implement text cleaning techniques like removing stop words, lemmatization, or stemming.
- **Additional Algorithms**: Experiment with different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
- **Custom Dataset Upload**: Allow users to upload their own dataset and retrain the model.
